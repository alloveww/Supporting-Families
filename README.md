## Project Description
Develop a database application about Quebec's midwifery services. This project involves logical data modeling, schema creation, populating the database, and implementing key application functionalities where midwives can track appointments, manage medical tests, and support personalized care.

## Features

* **Logical Data Modeling**: Designing the database structure to accurately represent the midwifery services domain.
* **Schema Creation**: Defining the database schema using DB2.
* **Database Population**: Inserting and managing data within the database.
* **Java Programming**: Implementing key functionalities and user interface.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Modeling:**
    * Designing the database structure based on the requirements. `data_model`
3. **Schema Creation:**
    * Creating the database schema in DB2. `schema`
5. **Database Population:**
    * Populating the database with relevant data. `schema`
7. **User Interaction:**
    * Understanding how midwives log into the application to manage appointments, medical tests, and more.`src`
9. **Application Development:**
    * Developing the application using Java to interact with the database.`src`


## Usage

1. **User Interface**:
    * Simple interface for midwives to log in and manage appointments and medical tests.

2. **Functionality**:
    * **Track Appointments**: Schedule, update, and view appointments.
    * **Manage Medical Tests**: Record test details, update results, and view test history.
    * **Review Notes**: View notes from appointments.
    * **Prescribe Tests**: Enter new test prescriptions.
    * **Check Appointments**: View appointments scheduled for a specific day.
    * **Verify Practitioner ID**: Ensure midwives have entered their practitioner IDs.
    * **Support Personalized Care**: Maintain records for each pregnancy.
